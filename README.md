Personal Podcast Project

This project aims to create a personalized podcast service that automatically generates audio recordings of articles from a user-specified list of journals.
Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites

The project is built using Python, so you will need to have a working Python environment in order to run the code. Additionally, the following libraries are required:

    Scrapy
    NLTK
    GPT-3
    SpeechRecognition

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Collecting Data

The first step in creating the personalized podcast is to collect a dataset of articles from a user-specified list of journals. To do this, we will use web-scraping techniques to automatically download articles on a daily basis.

Please note that it is important to check the terms of service of the journal's website and the copyright notice to ensure you are compliant.
Identifying Relevant Articles

Once we have collected a large dataset of articles, we will use natural language processing techniques such as text mining, information retrieval, and summarization to identify the articles that are most relevant to the user's interests. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are used for this purpose.
Summarizing Articles

To summarize the articles, we will use GPT-3, a powerful language generation model. However, the generated text is verified to make sense semantically before moving forward.
Generating Audio

Finally, we will use text-to-speech (TTS) algorithms to generate audio recordings that read out the summaries. We will use multiple TTS models to select the best one for this purpose.
Running the Project

The project can be run by executing the main.py file.

python main.py
