Hi, this is the Mayo Clinic Minute. 

Your wrists are a common casualty of winter. That's because they're one of the body parts most exposed to the cold. 

When it's cold outside, your body tries to keep warm by constricting blood vessels. That can cause inflammation and pain in your wrists. 

There are several things you can do to protect your wrists from the cold. First, dress in layers. That way, you can take off a layer if you start to feel too warm. Second, keep your hands and wrists covered. That includes wearing gloves when you go outside. 

If you do start to feel pain in your wrists, take a break from the cold and warm up. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers. 

If the pain doesn't go away or gets worse, it could be a sign of something more serious. So, see your doctor. 

That's the Mayo Clinic Minute.
