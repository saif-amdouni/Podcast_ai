Hi, welcome to the podcast!

So, we're all pretty familiar with at-home COVID-19 test kits at this point. You swab, wait, and then interpret the results yourself. But did you know that there's no such thing as an at-home flu test kit?

Why is that? Well, it turns out that the flu is a lot more complicated than COVID-19. There are many different strains of the flu, and they're constantly changing. That makes it very difficult to create a test that can accurately detect all of them.

Plus, the symptoms of the flu can be very similar to the symptoms of other respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19. So even if you did have an at-home flu test, it might not be accurate.

So, for now, the best way to find out if you have the flu is to see a doctor. They can give you a more accurate test and help you get the treatment you need.

Thanks for listening!
