Hi, welcome to the show.

Today we're going to be talking about a recent study that found that happy, loved teenagers tend to have better cardiovascular health in their 20s and 30s.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, looked at a group of teenagers over a period of 15 years.

They found that those who generally felt happy, optimistic and loved went on to show better cardiovascular health in their 20s and 30s, versus kids who lacked that level of mental well-being.

So, what does this tell us?

Well, it's pretty clear that our mental health has a big impact on our physical health.

And, it's never too early to start taking care of our mental health.

So, if you're a teenager out there, or you know a teenager, make sure to let them know that they're loved, and encourage them to pursue activities that make them happy.

It could make a big difference in their health down the road.

Thanks for listening.
