Hey there, welcome to episode 3 of the friendly and amusing podcast. Today, we'll be discussing the article, "Powering Down Cellphone Use in Middle Schools."

Some middle schools are taking drastic measures to decrease phone usage among students. They're banning phones during school hours, or only allowing them to be used during lunch and after school.

While some students and parents are on board with this, others are not. They argue that phones are a necessary tool for communication and education.

What do you think? Should middle schools ban phones, or are they a necessary part of 21st century learning? Let us know in the comments!
