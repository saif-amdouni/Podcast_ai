Hi, welcome to Health Nuts, the podcast where we talk all things health and wellness. Today, we're going to be talking about a recent study that found that eating 40 to 50 almonds per day can help with muscle soreness and fatigue after exercising.

Now, this was an industry-funded study, so we should take the results with a grain of salt. But it's still interesting to see what the research found.

Basically, the study found that almonds can help improve blood flow to the muscles, which can help with recovery after a workout. Almonds are also a good source of antioxidants, which can help reduce inflammation.

So, if you're looking to improve your workout recovery, eating 40 to 50 almonds per day may be a good place to start. Just remember to listen to your body and see how it responds. And, as always, consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before making any major changes to your diet.

That's all for today. Thanks for tuning in. We'll be back next week with more health and wellness news and tips.
