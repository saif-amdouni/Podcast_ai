Cervical cancer is a cancer that forms in the tissues of the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly over time. It is often found through a Pap test, which is a screening test for cervical cancer.

Cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is passed from one person to another through sexual contact. There are many types of HPV, and not all of them cause cancer.

Most people with HPV do not develop cervical cancer. In fact, most people with HPV will never even know they have it. HPV usually goes away on its own. But in some people, the virus does not go away. This can lead to cell changes on the cervix that can, over time, turn into cancer.

You can help protect yourself from HPV by getting the HPV vaccine. The HPV vaccine is recommended for girls and boys starting at age 11 or 12. The HPV vaccine is also recommended for young women through age 26 and young men through age 21.

You can also help protect yourself from HPV by using condoms the right way every time you have sex.
